AS USED IN THIS AGREEMENT, "NOVE", "US" OR "WE" REFERS TO NOVE, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES (AS DEFINED BELOW).</p>

<p class="p">THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS REQUIRING THAT YOU AGREE TO THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT RATHER THAN A JURY TRIAL OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, AND TO WAIVE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN CLASS ACTION OF ANY KIND AGAINST NOVE.</p>

</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 class="h4">2.3 Software Modifications</h2>

</div>

<div>
<h2 class="h3">3. Billing</h2>
<p class="h4">3.1 Recurring Billing</p>
<p class="p">In order to access those Services for which we require a subscription fee (“Paid Services”) you will be required to provide Nove with your credit card information (“Payment Method”). By providing a Payment Method you are authorizing us to charge your Payment Method on a monthly or annual basis, or as otherwise applicable for the subscription fees associated the Paid Services that you sign up for. Any Payment Method that you provide us must be valid, and kept current by you during the Subscription Term. By providing us with a Payment Method, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use such Payment Method. Nove will begin billing your Payment Method for the Paid Services on the day that you sign up for such Paid Services, regardless of whether you have fully configured the Paid Services as of that date.</p>

<h2 class="h4">3.2 Price Changes</h2>
<p class="p">We reserve the right to change the subscription fees that we charge for the Service, at any time in our sole discretion, provided that we give you at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice of such changes. Unless otherwise specified in such notice to you, any changes to the subscription fees will take effect in the billing period immediately following our notice to you.</p>

<h2 class="h4">3.3 No Refunds</h2>
<p class="p">SUBSCRIPTION FEES ARE NONREFUNDABLE. YOU WILL BE BILLED IN FULL FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM IN WHICH YOU CANCEL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED FOR THE UNUSED PORTION OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the Paid Services through the end of your current Subscription Term. We may, in our sole discretion, provide a refund, discount, or credit (“Credits”) to you in a specific instance, however the provision of Credits in a specific instance does not entitle you to Credits in the future for similar instances or obligate us to provide additional Credits.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 class="h3">4. Beta Services</h2>
<p class="p">From time to time, we may make early stage or non-production Software (“Beta Services”) available to you at no charge. You may access these Beta Services in your sole discretion. Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes only, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to you at the time of sign-up. Nove may, but is not obligated to, provide you with support for the Beta Services or correct any bugs, defects, or errors in the Beta Services. Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from the trial start date or the date that a version of the Beta Services becomes generally available without the applicable Beta Services designation. We may discontinue Beta Services at any time in our sole discretion and may never make them generally available. Notwithstanding Section 10, we will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with any Beta Services.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="h3">5. Security</h2>
<p class="p">We implement security procedures to help protect your Data from security threats.

<div>
<h2 class="h3">8. Indemnification</h2>
<p class="h4">8.1 By Nove</p>
<p class="p">Nove will defend you against any third party claim brought against you, to the extent that such claim is based on an allegation that a Paid Service, when used as authorized under this Agreement, infringes a United States or European Union patent or registered copyright (a "Claim"), and we will indemnify you against any damages and costs (including reasonable legal fees) finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction attributable to such a Claim or agreed to settlement by Nove. If any portion of a Paid Service becomes, or in Nove’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Nove may, at Nove’s option: (a) procure the right for you to continue using the Paid Service; (b) replace the Paid Service with non-infringing services which do not materially impair the functionality of the Paid Service; (c) modify the Paid Service so that it becomes non-infringing; or (d) terminate the Paid Service and refund any pre-paid subscription fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term, and upon such termination, you will immediately cease all use of the Paid Service. Nove will have no obligation under this Section 8 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (w) any use of a Paid Service not in accordance with this Agreement or the Documentation; any use of a Paid Service in combination with third party products or services not supplied by Nove; or (z) any modification of a Paid Service by any person other than Nove or its authorized agents. THIS SUBSECTION SETS FORTH NOVE’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS, AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 class="h4">8.2 By You</h2>
<p class="p">You agree that you will be responsible for your use of the Service, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Nove and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, Affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (collectively, the "Nove Entities") from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Service; (ii) your violation of this Agreement or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; or (iv) any disputes or issues between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (and without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.</p>

You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign this Agreement at any time without notice.

</div>

<div>
<h2 class="h3">15. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
<p class="h4">15.1 Generally</p>
<p class="p">In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Nove in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Nove agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND NOVE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

<h2 class="h4">15.2 Exceptions</h2>
<p class="p">Notwithstanding Subsection 15.1, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>

<h2 class="h4">15.3 Arbitrator</h2>
<p class="p">Any arbitration between you and Nove will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures ("AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>

<h2 class="h4">15.4 Notice; Process</h2>
<p class="p">
  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Nove's address for Notice is: <?php echo $nove_address; ?>. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Nove may commence an arbitration proceeding.
</p>

<h2 class="h4">15.5 Fees</h2>
<p class="p">
  Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Seattle, WA provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Nove for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
</p>

<h2 class="h4">15.6 No Class Actions</h2>
<p class="p">
  YOU AND NOVE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Nove agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
</p>

<h2 class="h4">15.7 Modifications</h2>
<p class="p">In the event that Nove makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Nove's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Nove's address for Notice, in which case your account with Nove will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.</p>

<h2 class="h4">15.8 Enforceability</h2>
<p class="p">If Subsection 15.1 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 10 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.</p>
</div>

<div>
